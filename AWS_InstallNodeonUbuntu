Option 1: Install Node.js with Node Version Manager
First, make sure you have a C++ compiler. Open the terminal and install the build-essential and libssl-dev packages if needed. By default, Ubuntu does not come with these tools â€” but they can be installed in the command line.

Use apt-get to install the build-essential package:

1
sudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall
Employ a similar process to get libssl-dev:

1
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
You can install and update Node Version Manager, or nvm, by using cURL:

1
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.0/install.sh | bash
You will be asked to close and reopen the terminal. To verify that nvm has been successfully installed after you reopen the terminal, use:

1
command -v nvm
That command will output nvm if the installation worked.
